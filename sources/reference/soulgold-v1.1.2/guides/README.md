# Writing player guides

Create one Markdown file per guide in this directory. The Guides page discovers
them automatically when `tools/soulgold_docs/build_docs.py` runs.

Start a guide with this optional metadata block:

```markdown
---
title: Finding Lugia
summary: Where to begin the quest and how to reach Lugia.
category: Legendaries
order: 20
---
```

Write the rest with normal Markdown headings, paragraphs, numbered or bulleted
lists, links, block quotes, inline code, and fenced code blocks. A level-one
heading can be used instead of `title`; it is used as the guide title rather
than repeated in the expanded article.

To attach a picture, put it in `images/` and reference it relative to this
directory:

```markdown
![The entrance to the hidden cave](images/hidden-cave.png)
```

Append `{small}`, `{medium}`, or `{large}` to control an image's displayed
width. Images remain responsive and will shrink further to fit narrow screens:

```markdown
![A compact dialogue screenshot](images/dialogue.png){small}
![A regular gameplay screenshot](images/gameplay.png){medium}
![A detailed map](images/map.png){large}
```

The maximum widths are 360, 640, and 1000 pixels respectively. Omitting the
size uses the existing large image limit. Misspelled or unsupported sizes fail
the documentation build with an explanatory error.

Link to another published guide with its relative Markdown filename. The site
turns it into that guide's shareable URL:

```markdown
[Read the legendary prerequisites](legendary-prerequisites.md)
```

Guide slugs, local links, and attached files are validated during the docs
build. A missing picture, duplicate slug, or link to an unpublished Markdown
file fails the build instead of publishing a broken guide.

Files named `README.md` and files whose names begin with `_` are authoring aids
and are not published. Copy `_template.md` when starting a guide.
